Mobile swipe gallery (modern mobile browsers only).
===========

This gallery uses css3 for comfort UX while changing images.

Gallery is 'endless', if last image is reached - the first one will become next.

Gallery utilises only 3 img tags, so it aimed to be resource-efficient and may be used to display large amounts of images

 For more comfort use:

 `npm install`

 `grunt connect`

 then visit
 [http://localhost:9001/directories.html](http://localhost:9001/index.html)
